<p> Visit <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" rel="nofollow">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a> and download the version of Node that corresponds to your operating system and specific machine.  Once the download is complete, open up the package and run the installer.  </p><p>To verify the install, open up your command line and try running:</p>

<p><code>node -v</code> <br></p><p>If you see any version number (doesn't really matter which version), you're good to go!  If you get an error message instead, the installation may not have worked. Post on the discussion board to get some help.</p></p>
