Please be patient with us!</p><p>If you're curious about why Cloud9 now requires a credit card to sign up, read a discussion on it <a href="https://community.c9.io/t/credit-card-required-for-free-account/7434" rel="nofollow">here</a>.Thanks for understanding!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Colt</strong></p><p>P.S here's a picture of my cat:</p><figure><img height="240" src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2017-09-28_02-53-17-05822dfc4f6acf9aab86a9d96eebb89e.JPG" width="318"></figure><p><br></p>
