Things have changed, and modern JS looks very different than it used to.</p><p>Fortunately, we also have content to help catch you up on ES2015 and ES23016. We <strong>STRONGLY recommend </strong>you take an hour or two first to<strong> review our sections on ES2015 and ES2016</strong>. It won't take long!</p><p>If anyone actually reads these messages, thank you for making it this far! We wrote this because we noticed students were jumping straight to React without first going through the prerequisite content.  I know React is exciting, but trust us on this one, you don't want to try and learn things like arrow functions and the spread operator as you're also trying to learn React.  </p></p>
