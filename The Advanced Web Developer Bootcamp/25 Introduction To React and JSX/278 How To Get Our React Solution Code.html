<p>To get access to all of the coding examples in the React section, you have two options:</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://github.com/rithmschool/udemy_course_exercises/tree/master/react" rel="nofollow">View the code on Github here</a> - no signup required</li><li> <a href="https://ide.c9.io/learnwithcolt/wdb-part2" rel="nofollow">View the code on Cloud9 here</a></li></ol>



<p>NOTE: You must have a cloud9 account to see the workspace, but don't worry, it's free.  </p>



<p><strong></strong></p>





<p>If you do not have access to a credit card please follow these instructions to get an account.  Remember, <strong>Cloud9 will not charge your credit card</strong>, it's purely for security reasons and to prevent bots from abusing their service.  I understand why they needed to implement this policy, but it's also very frustrating because I know many of students come from countries where credit cards are not commonly used.  Luckily, we have a workaround!
</p>





<p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:webdevbootcampinfo@gmail.com" rel="nofollow">webdevbootcampinfo@gmail.com</a> and we can send you an invitation to c9 that does <em>not</em> require a credit card.  
</p>





<p>Unfortunately, <strong>this is a very manual process for us</strong>, so it can take some time if we're asleep or away from email access. Please be patient with us!</p>





<p>If you're curious about why Cloud9 now requires a credit card to sign up, read a discussion on it <a href="https://community.c9.io/t/credit-card-required-for-free-account/7434" rel="nofollow">here</a>.Thanks for understanding!<strong></strong></p>
